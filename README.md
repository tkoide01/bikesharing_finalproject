## Communication Protocols

The group communicates regularly over slack, sharing ideas and datasets as well as discussing next steps. Additionally, the group utilizes Zoom to meet outside of class hours. 

## Methodology

- We will use Visualization using Tableau and R. 

## Provisional Model for Machine Learning

- Run a series of regression on correlation between the factors such as weather, seasonality, characteristics of area (office, leisure, academic, etc…) with the usage of PBS.
- Visualize the maps of each city and  show popular routes. Combine the map image with layering and pop-up highlighting the major stations, landmarks to assess the main incentives of riders choosing that routes.
